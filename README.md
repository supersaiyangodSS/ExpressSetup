# Nodejs and ExpressJs BoilerPlate Setup

## Description
This is a Node.js Express project that serves as a basic starting point for web development.

## Features
- Sets up an Express server with a simple 'Hello, World!' route
- Uses Nodemon for automatic server restart during development
- Provides a basic project structure to build upon

## Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-name`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm run server`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
- You can modify the `app.js` file to add more routes and functionality to your server.
